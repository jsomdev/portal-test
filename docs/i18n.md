# Internationalization (i18n)

## Introduction

The application will support multiple languages and, based on the culture / locale of the user, formatting of numbers, dates,... [React-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) will be used for translations and formatting. Next.js has built in [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing) for internationalization. Some internal logic will be applied for using the correct translation files. 

## Routing Configuration

Consider the following configuration in our next.config.js (irrelevant code has been omitted from the snippet)

```js
//next.config.js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/categorieen/:categorySlug',
        destination: '/categories/:categorySlug'
      },
      {
        source: '/producten/:productSlug',
        destination: '/products/:productSlug'
      }
    ];
  },
  i18n: {
    locales: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_LOCALES.split(','),
    defaultLocale: 'en',
    //localDetection: true
  },
};
```

The supported locales are defined using environment variables

```env
//.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_LOCALES = en,en-US,nl,nl-BE,fr-CA;
```

**This will:**

1. Provide routing integration for all supported locales.
2. Treat 'en' as default locale. (or fallback if the automatically detected locale is not supported)

## Sub-path routing use cases

The configuration described above, and the way Next.js Link components work, provide a solution for the following use cases.

- Automatically detect the locale of the user and apply it if it's supported.
- Sharing a url will include the locale.
- Able to switch between languages easily.
- Rewrite internationalized slugs.

## Routing examples

When you go to 'https://portal.spray.com' it will automatically detect your locale and suffix it to your url. If your browser language settings are set to 'en-US' it will not append anything since 'en-US' will be the default locale. If your browser language settings are set to 'nl-BE' and this locale is supported  it will append the locale to the url: 'https://portal.spray.com/nl-BE'. The locale will remain when navigating within the application. If you go to a sub-route directly, the application will use the locale (or 'en-US' if none is included) in the url. If that locale is not supported, a 404 page will be shown.

Each supported locale can have its own version of a page. An example of a localized path is: 'https://portal.spray.com/nl-BE/producten/1-2k-316ss40'. The default 'en-US' url for this product is: 'https://portal.spray.com/products/1-2k-316ss40'

## Multilingual strings

Datasets that are returned from the api have multilingual properties like name, description, .... These properties are a Record<key, value> type where key is the language code and value is a string.  A string value for *en* is mandatory.

```typescript
// MultilingualString.ts
export type MultilingualString = {
  en: string;
  [key: string]: string;
};

// any declaration
const name: MultilingualString = {
	en: 'Nozzles',
	nl: 'Sproeikoppen'
}
```

Note: If the locale is set to 'fr-CA', there won't be a value for name[fr] so the formatted value will default to the name[en] value.



## Application wide translations / formatting

### Translations for static text

Text that is part of the source code will be stored in resource files. Translations will be mapped by their ids. Based on the active locale in the application the correct resource file will be loaded with all translations. All of these resource files need to be maintained.

```typescript
// en.ts (this can be stored inside of a json file as well)
import { Messages } from './types';

/**
 * The English translations
 */
export const en: Messages = {
  navigation: {
    main: {
      title: 'Categories',
      collapseLabel: 'navigation.main.collapseLabel',
      expandLabel: 'navigation.main.expandLabel'
    },
    site: {
      title: 'Organization',
      collapseLabel: 'navigation.site.collapseLabel',
      expandLabel: 'navigation.site.expandLabel'
    },
    user: {
      title: 'My Account',
      collapseLabel: 'navigation.user.collapseLabel',
      expandLabel: 'navigation.user.expandLabel',
      signIn: 'Sign in',
      myProfile: 'My Profile'
    }
  },
  pages: {
    home: {
      headTitle: 'Welcome',
      headDescription: 'Experts in Spray Technology | Spraying Systems Co.'
    },
    model: {
      headTitle: 'Model',
      // Name is a variable that need to be injected at runtime
      headDescription: '{name} | Spraying Systems Co.'
    },
    category: {
      headTitle: 'Category',
      headDescription: '{name} | Spraying Systems Co.'
    },
    series: {
      headTitle: 'Series',
      headDescription: '{name} | Spraying Systems Co.'
    },
    docs: {
      i18n: {
        title: 'Internationalization',
        description: 'Documentation about i18n in the project'
      },
      testing: {
        title: 'Testing',
        description: 'Documentation about testing in the project'
      },
      userInterfaces: {
        title: 'User Interfaces, Layout and Design',
        description:
          'Documentation about user interfaces, layout and design in the project'
      },
      projectSetup: {
        title: 'Project Setup',
        description:
          'Documentation about project setup and configuration in the project'
      }
    }
  }
};

```

### Formatting

When formatting using the react-intl context, the locale / language that was set in the provider, will be injected when using this functionality.

#### Messages

```typescript
const Category: NextPage<CategoryProps & AppLayoutProps> = ({
  category,
  siteMenuItems,
  mainMenuItems
}) => {
  const { pathname } = useRouter();
  // Consume the context from react-intl
  const { formatMessage, locale } = useIntl();
  // Define the messages based on their ids (these ids are references to their value in the translation files)
  const messages = defineMessages({
    headTitle: {
      id: messageIds.pages.category.headTitle,
      description: 'Page metadata title',
      defaultMessage: 'Welcome'
    },
    headDescription: {
      id: messageIds.pages.category.headDescription,
      description: 'Page metadata description',
      defaultMessage: 'Experts in Spray Technology | Spraying Systems Co.'
    }
  });
  return (
    <AppLayout siteMenuItems={siteMenuItems} mainMenuItems={mainMenuItems}>
      <Head
        pathname={pathname}
        // The message can be formatted with a dynamic variable that will be injected in the message
        title={formatMessage(messages.headTitle, {
          name: formatMultilingualString(category?.name, locale)
        })}
        description={formatMessage(messages.headDescription)}
      />
      {category?.name?.en}
    </AppLayout>
  );
};
```



#### Date

```jsx
<FormattedDate 
 	dateStyle="full"
 	value={new Date(order.submittedOn || '')}
/>
```

```typescript
const date = formatDate(new Date(order?.submittedOn || ''), {
      dateStyle: 'full',
    });
```



#### Numbers and Currencies

```typescript
// Currency example
formatNumber(totalPrice, {
          currency: checkoutItems?.[0].priceBreaks?.[0].currencyCode || 'USD',
          currencyDisplay: 'narrowSymbol',
          style: 'currency',
        }))
// Number example
     <FormattedNumber value={modelsCount} />
```





## SEO Optimization

To let search engines know about alternative versions of the page, a `<link>` must be included for each version (including the default) with `rel="alternate"` and `hreflang="${locale}"` defined properly.

There's multiple ways to achieve this. Adding them to the sitemap generation or adding them to the `<Head>` of each page.

In the first iteration of the application, the second approach will be implemented.

This function will generate alternate links that should be added to the `<Head>`

```typescript
/**
 * Function that renders alternate links for SEO purposes.
 * These should be added to the <Head>.
 * @param pathname name of the path that the links are generated for (e.g. /docs/i18n)
 * @returns an Array of alternate <link> components
 */
function renderAlternateLinks(pathname: string) {
  return (supportedLocales || []).map((locale) => (
    <link
      key={locale}
      rel="alternate"
      hrefLang={locale}
      href={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/${locale}${pathname}`}
    />
  ));
}
```
## Audience
The portal is a multi-regonial application. This means that data shown in the application can be different based on the region the users locale belongs to. For example: North American users will see North American products and categories with a menu to reflect that, whilst European users will see other products. They may be able to access these products but will be notified.

For server-side generated data, all data will be retrieved and cached, but at request time (SSR) or at build time (SSG), this data will be filtered by the audience that is currently active.

```typescript
/**
 * Function that will filter a collection of MenuItems by Audience
 * (e.g.: If the audience of the application is Europe, the audience of the MenuItem must either be Europe)
 * @param audience The Audience that each MenuItem must match with
 * @param menuItems A collection of MenuItems that need filtering
 * @returns A collection of filtered MenuItems that match the Audience
 */
function filterMenuItemsByAudience(
  audience: Audience | undefined,
  menuItems: MenuItem[]
): MenuItem[] {
  return menuItems.filter(item => {
    const menuItemAudience: Audience = FlaggedEnum.create<Audience>(
      Audience,
      item.audience || Audience.NorthAmerica
    );

    return !!(menuItemAudience & (audience || Audience.NorthAmerica));
  });
}
```
